<!-- You will create a small Node and Express server application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!
Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.
Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.
Once you have an idea in mind, briefly discuss it with your instructors to determine if it is appropriate for the amount of time you have been given.
Since topic and content are secondary to functionality for this assessment, we have included some resources below for free content that you can use to populate your application. Once you have gotten your functionality in place, you can return and fill in the content with something interesting.
Resources for free content:
Text: Lipsum, a Lorem Ipsum text generator.
Images: Pexels, a resource for stock photos (and other media).
GIFs: Motion Elements, a resource for GIFs (and other media).

The requirements listed here are absolute minimums. Ensure that your application meets these requirements before attempting to further expand your features.
Create your application locally, and initialize a local git repo. Make frequent commits to the repo. When your application is complete, push your repo to GitHub and submit the link to the GitHub page using the submission instructions at the top of this document.

*** Requirements ***

Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware.

Create and use error-handling middleware.

Use at least three different data categories (e.g., users, posts, or comments).

Utilize reasonable data structuring practices.

Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client.

Create POST routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client creation via a POST request.

Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request.

Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request.

Utilize route parameters, where appropriate.

Adhere to the guiding principles of REST.

Utilize reasonable code organization practices.

Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).

Commit frequently to the git repository.

Include a README file that contains a description of your application.

Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience. -->
